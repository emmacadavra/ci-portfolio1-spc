# **The Sheffield Philharmonic Chorus**
## **Site Overview**
The Sheffield Philharmonic Chorus is the foremost large mixed-voice choir in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, and the purpose of this website is to act as a first stop for people interested in joining the choir. The choir’s ethos is to share its love of a large range of choral music by performing it periodically, and to continue to do this they rely on new members seeking them out and joining them.
