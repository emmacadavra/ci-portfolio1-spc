# **The Sheffield Philharmonic Chorus**
## **Site Overview**
The Sheffield Philharmonic Chorus is the foremost large mixed-voice choir in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, and the purpose of this website is to act as a first stop for people interested in joining the choir. The choir’s ethos is to share its love of a large range of choral music by performing it periodically, and to continue to do this they rely on new members seeking them out and joining them.

(INFO ABOUT COLOURS)

## **Typography:**

* Throughout the page, there are 3 fonts used:
    * Playfair Display
    * Roboto Serif
    * Roboto Slab
​
* The ‘Playfair Display’ font was chosen to match the Sheffield Philharmonic Chorus logo, seen in the logo in the ‘Join Us’ sections of the site.
* Roboto Slab was chosen as the font for the majority of the body of the site as it maintains readability whilst appearing sophisticated.
* Roboto Serif was chosen for the opening paragraph due to it being better suited to italic styling than Roboto Slab.
* All fonts were sourced from Google fonts, as stated in the credits.

## **Current Features Common to All Pages**
#### **Header and Navigation Bar**

The header sits atop the page in a fixed position, so that the site title is always visible to the user, for a simple and pleasant user experience. Within the header, there is a navigation bar, which appears in two separate forms depending on the screen size of the user.

On larger screens, such as laptops and desktops, the navigation bar displays all three navigation links in the top-right corner of the screen.

On smaller screens, such as tablets and mobile phones, the navigation bar menu appears as a hamburger menu in the top-right corner, which expands when clicked on to reveal the page links. The purpose of this is to prevent the header from taking up too much room on smaller screens, providing an optimal experience.

In each case, the links are obvious and readable for a smooth user experience.

#### **Section Images**

Sections one and two (‘Home’ and ‘About Us’) feature a large image that makes up 50% of the section as a whole. The decision to include images that take up a large part of each section was made in order to make the site more visually eye-catching and appealing, with the additional benefit of not overloading the user with too much text at once.

(screenshot of smaller screen)

On smaller screens, the images appear landscape, and are positioned below the content of the section.

(screenshot of larger screen)

On larger screens, the images appear next to the content of the section, with section two’s order having been reversed for an engaging visual effect.

(section one image)

Section one’s image was chosen for its eye-catching location’s grandeur, and sets a very professional and serene tone. It also suggests an important level of inclusiveness for those who prefer to wear masks since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic.

(section two image)

Section two’s image is a lot more casual, and this is to show the other side of the chorus which is friendly, approachable, and full of smiles. This is so that users of the website can see that the choir is both professional, and also relaxed and welcoming.

The images are responsive, and will adapt to the screen size and position without stretching or shrinking.

#### **SPC Logo**

Section three contains the Sheffield Philharmonic Chorus logo, in reverse colours to that of the header. This contrast is visually pleasing, and helps to establish the brand in the eyes of the users. It appears circular so as to stand out from the other images on the page.

(screenshot of logo on smaller screen)

On smaller screens, the logo appears at the very bottom of the page, above the footer.

(screenshot of logo on larger screen)

On larger screens, the logo appears on the left-hand side of the screen, before the sign-up form.

The logo image is responsive, and a maximum width has been set so that it does not distort or stretch above the image’s maximum dimensions.
