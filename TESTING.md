## **Testing Throughout Development**

During development, I manually tested the website as I went along by using the 'python3 -m http.server' command in GitPod's VSCode workspace. This created a live version of the website, and every time I saved my work on GitPod I could refresh the page to see whether my code was working as intended. Google Chrome is my default browser, so I was predominantly using Chrome's DevTools to allow me to test the content across different screen sizes, as well as using it as a first point of call for bug fixes, as it enabled me to tweak the code, disable certain elements and add to them without directly impacting the website itself. 

At various stages throughout development, before deploying the website to GitHub Pages, I made the server I was working on public so that I could test it on other devices such as my mobile phone. I would also share it with certain people to see how certain things looked on their devices, asking them to confirm that the site was functional and/or visually appealing so that I could get an idea of how the website performed across a variety of devices.

Once I was happy with the overall design of the website, I deployed it to GitHub Pages so that I could share the link with more people, and begin making necessary tweaks and debugging more efficiently.

The site's functionality has been tested and confirmed as fully responsive across different breakpoints with no issues on the following browsers on both mobile and desktop:

* Google Chrome
* Mozilla Firefox
* Microsoft Edge
* Safari
