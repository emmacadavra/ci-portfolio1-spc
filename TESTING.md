## **Testing Throughout Development**

During development, I manually tested the website as I went along by using the 'python3 -m http.server' command in GitPod's VSCode workspace. I use Google Chrome, so I was predominantly using Chrome's DevTools to allow me to test the content across different screen sizes.

At various stages throughout development, I also made the server public and shared it with several people, asking them to confirm that the site was functional on their devices so that I could get an idea of whether the site looked good to different people across different devices.

The site's functionality has been tested and confirmed as fully responsive across different breakpoints with no issues on the following browsers on both mobile and desktop:

* Google Chrome
* Mozilla Firefox
* Microsoft Edge
* Safari
