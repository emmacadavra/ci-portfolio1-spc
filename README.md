# **The Sheffield Philharmonic Chorus**
## **Site Overview**
The Sheffield Philharmonic Chorus is the foremost large mixed-voice choir in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, and the purpose of this website is to act as a first stop for people interested in joining the choir. The choir’s ethos is to share its love of a large range of choral music by performing it periodically, and to continue to do this they rely on new members seeking them out and joining them.

## **Typography:**

* Throughout the page, there are 3 fonts used:
    * Playfair Display
    * Roboto Serif
    * Roboto Slab
​
* The ‘Playfair Display’ font was chosen to match the Sheffield Philharmonic Chorus logo, seen in the logo in the ‘Join Us’ sections of the site.
* Roboto Slab was chosen as the font for the majority of the body of the site as it maintains readability whilst appearing sophisticated.
* Roboto Serif was chosen for the opening paragraph due to it being better suited to italic styling than Roboto Slab.
* All fonts were sourced from Google fonts, as stated in the credits.
