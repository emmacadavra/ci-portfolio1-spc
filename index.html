            <p class="opening-paragraph">Welcome to the homepage of South Yorkshire's foremost large mixed-voice choir!
            </p>
            <p>Sheffield, like many towns and cities in Yorkshire, has a long and distinguished tradition of
                music-making, particularly with its choruses. The Sheffield Philharmonic Chorus was officially formed
                alongside the Sheffield Philhamornic Society in 1935, following the opening of Sheffield City Hall in
                1930, though the chorus' origins date back many decades further. To this day, we perform with Orchestra
                in Residence the Hallé and acclaimed soloists as part of the Sheffield International Concert Season at
                the City Hall in Sheffield, and are a proud member of <a href="https://classicalsheffield.org.uk/"
                    target="_blank" rel="noopener">Classical Sheffield</a>.
            </p>
            <p>Currently over 160 voices strong, we regularly sing with leading orchestras including the Hallé, the BBC
                Philharmonic, the Northern Sinfonia and the Manchester Camerata, and frequently collaborate with other
                large choirs such as the Hallé Chorus, the Leeds Philharmonic Chorus and the Halifax Choral Society. We
                have also performed our exciting and varied repertoire of choral music all over the UK, and in many
                parts of Europe.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Our Rehearsals</h2>
            <p>We rehearse regularly throughout the concert season, which takes place between each September and June.
                Our rehearsals are held on Tuesday evenings between 7pm - 9pm, at King Edward VII Upper School on
                Glossop Road, Sheffield S10 2PW. The rehearsals are led by our Music Director, Darius Battiwala, and
                accompanied by our pianist, Rachel Fright. We are very fortunate to have the talented Maggie McDonald as
                our Vocal Coach, who attends every few rehearsals to take us through vocal exercises to improve our
                voice. Individual members of the choir are also able to have short sessions with her during these
                rehearsals.
            </p>
            <p>We are always happy to welcome new members, and encourage any prospective new members to come and try us
                out by rehearsing with us for a few weeks before deciding whether you would like to join. Research has
                shown that singing greatly benefits our health and wellbeing, improves posture and sleep, increases
                mental alertness, and improves mood. Our passion is singing and sharing beautiful choral music with
                others, and our aim is to be as inclusive as possible - and of course to have fun! So don't be shy, and
                please feel free to come along and sing with us. Joining our rehearsals is a great way to improve your
                music appreciation, technique and knowledge - and make new friends!
